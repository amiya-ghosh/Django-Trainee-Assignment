Q1.By default are django signals executed synchronously or asynchronously? Please support your answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance. The code does not need to be elegant and production ready, we just need to understand your logic.

Answer:- By default, Django signals are executed synchronously.

from django.db import models
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
import time

class TestModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

@receiver(post_save, sender=TestModel)
def signal_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print("Signal started")
    time.sleep(5)
    print("Signal finished")

# views.py
from django.http import HttpResponse
from .models import TestModel
import time

def test_view(request):
    start = time.time()
    TestModel.objects.create(name="Test")
    end = time.time()
    print("View execution time:", end - start)
    return HttpResponse("Done")

Q2. Do django signals run in the same thread as the caller? Please support your answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance. The code does not need to be elegant and production ready, we just need to understand your logic.

Answer:- Yes, by default Django signals run in the same thread as the caller.

# models.py
import threading
from django.db import models
from django.db.models.signals import post_save

class ThreadTestModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

@receiver(post_save, sender=ThreadTestModel)
def thread_signal(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print("Signal thread ID:", threading.get_ident())

Q3.By default do django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller? Please support your answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance. The code does not need to be elegant and production ready, we just need to understand your logic.

Answer:- Yes, by default, signals like post_save run inside the same transaction, unless explicitly deferred using tools like on_commit.


from django.db import models, connection
from django.db.models.signals import post_save

class TxModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

@receiver(post_save, sender=TxModel)
def tx_signal(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM yourapp_txmodel")
        print("Count in signal:", cursor.fetchone()[0])


--------------Class of Rectangle-------

class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length: int, width: int):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def __iter__(self):
        yield {'length': self.length}
        yield {'width': self.width}

r = Rectangle(5, 3)
for dim in r:
    print(dim)


Output:-
{'length': 5}
{'width': 3}
